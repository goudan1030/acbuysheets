              <strong>Finding the Items:</strong> To begin your search, create accounts on Reddit and and join the r/FashionReps and r/acbuy Reddit and Discord server. These platforms will assist you in discovering the items you desire. For instance, in the Fashion Reps subreddit, you can search for specific products or explore comparisons. Often, users or bots will provide links to the items you're interested in. Remember, acbuy is a service that facilitates purchases but doesn't sell items directly. Therefore, you need to find the product links on other platforms supported by acbuy. Product links can be found in various spreadsheets made by the community.

              <strong>Using Product Links:</strong> Once you have the link to the item you wish to purchase, simply copy it and paste it into the search bar on the acbuy website. Alternatively, you can use the reverse image search feature by uploading a photo of the item to find similar products. This method proves useful when you can't locate an item through regular searching.

The status will change from "Process Pending" to "Purchased" once an agent is assigned and the item is purchased from the seller. Subsequently, it will change to "Seller Sent" when the seller dispatches the item to the warehouse. At this point, you'll receive an Express Tracking section to monitor the shipping progress within China. Eventually, the status will change to "Warehouse Received" when the warehouse acknowledges the arrival of your item.

After verifying the item's condition, you can proceed with the shipment. The shipping options will be displayed, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs. Keep in mind that faster shipping methods may incur higher costs.
